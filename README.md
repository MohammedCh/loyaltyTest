# loyaltyTest
1) The two main folders, "company" and "loyaltyService" run on a separate local hosts. You can start each by running "npm start"
2) Start mongoDB. Both services use the same database, but separate collections
3) "company" has a front end. Sign up with a random email (no real sign up, just adding email to the DB). Add receipts after you sign in and see your "Current balance" update. Current balance comes from the LoyaltyService.
